    <h1 class="title">Scripty vs Scriptly</h1>

    <a href="https://scriptly.xyz">You can check out Scriptly here.</a>

    <p>
      We'll be the first to admit, we're biased. We made Scripty, so take what we say with a grain of salt.<br>
      Most of the information we got about Scriptly was obtained from its site, and through some internet sleuthing,
      so it may not be 100% accurate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: this page was last updated August 8, 2022, so it may be out of date.
      Refer directly to Scriptly and Scripty's websites for the latest up-to-date information.
    </p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Details</h2>

    <p>
      Scripty and Scriptly happened to be named very similarly to each other by pure random chance.
      Neither of us intended to be named similar to the other.<br>
      If you compare the creation dates of both bots, you'll notice Scripty was created two months earlier than Scriptly,
      on February 17th, 2021, whereas Scriptly was created April 10th, 2021.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Features</h2>

    <p>
      According to Scriptly's homepage, they offer the following features:
    </p>
    <blockquote><i>
      It provides immersive features such as voice to text transcription, text to speech vocality,
      and, in the premium version, translation via voice between 2 languages.
    </i></blockquote>
    <p>
      Their documentation offers more information on what they support, including being able to customize your text-to-speech voice.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, at the moment, Scripty only supports speech-to-text, but plans to support text-to-speech in the future.
      Translation, however, is not planned, due to the cost of running this whilst also ensuring user privacy by not sharing data with third parties.
      Scripty also plans to support custom text-to-speech voices in the future.
      <br>
      You can refer to the table below for a tabular breakdown of the features between the two bots.
    </p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Premium Features</h2>

    <p>
      According to Scriptly's homepage, they currently do <i>not</i> offer premium, but when it is released, it will include the following features:
    </p>
    <blockquote><i>
      The premium version of the bot has many features that help improve the experience for our users.<br><br>

      ‚Ä¢ Translation via voice between 2 people.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ Higher quality transcription (more accurate)<br>
      ‚Ä¢ More fluent TTS (text to speech)<br>
      ‚Ä¢ Faster transcription<br>
      ‚Ä¢ Priority support in our support server<br>
      ‚Ä¢ Priority access to new features<br>
      ‚Ä¢ And more!
    </i></blockquote>

    <p>
      Scripty, on the other hand, plans to support Premium incredibly soon. In fact, by the time you read this, it's very likely already out.
      Scripty's Premium does not change the quality or speed of transcriptions.
      We believe everyone, regardless of their ability to pay, should experience the highest quality transcriptions we can offer them.<br>

    <h2>Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      Note that we are not Scriptly's team. We do not know for sure whether any of Scriptly's information is 100% true.
      This is what we've deduced based on some internet sleuthing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Scriptly uses <a href="https://wit.ai">Wit.Ai</a>, a free speech-to-text API made by Facebook (now Meta).<br>
      Due to this API being owned by Meta, and being free, there is an <i>extremely</i> high chance Meta is using
      your voice data for their own purposes, including marketing and advertising. To be completely clear,
      the Scriptly team is (very likely, we can't verify as Scriptly is closed-source) not mining any of your data.
      Meta is mining this data.
    </p>
    <button class="js-modal-trigger button is-danger" data-target="personal-opinion-modal">Personal Opinion (click to show)</button>

    <p>
      Scripty, on the other hand, uses <a href="https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT">Coqui STT</a>.
      This is an offline speech-to-text library, meaning it runs entirely on our machines.
      No data is sent to any third parties, and we do not use any of your data for any purposes.
      You can independently verify this, as Scripty is open-source at <a href="https://github.com/scripty-bot/scripty">GitHub</a>.
      However, due to this, Scripty is much more expensive to run, which forces us to offer expensive Premium.

        Meta is a company well known for its privacy abuses (see links below). We can pretty much guarantee Meta is mining the data
        that Scriptly sends it in the form of voice, and using it as an additional source of data on you,
        which they can then sell to data brokers.<br>
        I would personally not use Scriptly because of this.<br>
        There are an incredible number of articles: so many, that this isn't even the tip of the iceberg.
        Go search up "facebook privacy" and you'll find a long, long, long list of articles.<br>
        I personally strongly recommend against giving Facebook/Meta any more of your data, which means not using Scriptly.

          root access to a user's device and gather information, such as constant location tracking and messages and
          media from third-party apps.

          devised for figuring out that seeming strangers on the network might know each other. One filed in 2015
          describes a technique that would connect two people through the camera metadata associated with the photos
          they uploaded. It might assume two people knew each other if the images they uploaded looked like they were
          titled in the same series of photos‚ÄîIMG_4605739.jpg and IMG_4605742, for example‚Äîor if lens scratches or dust
          were detectable in the same spots on the photos, revealing the photos were taken by the same camera.
        </blockquote>
        Hell, if they can track you using <i>camera lens dust</i>, they're more than capable of doing the same with your voice.

        <blockquote>
          Chicago attorney Jay Edelson sued Facebook in Cook County Circuit Court back in 2015, alleging that the
          platform‚Äôs use of facial recognition tagging was not allowed under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy
          Act. The lawsuit claimed that Facebook‚Äôs Tag Suggestions tool, which scanned faces in users‚Äô photos and
          offered suggestions about who the person might be, stored biometric data without users‚Äô consent in violation
          of the Illinois law.

        </a>
        <blockquote>
          Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) on Monday sued Facebook‚Äôs parent company, Meta Platforms Inc.,
          alleging that the social media giant for years collected Texans‚Äô biometric data without their full consent,
          in violation of state privacy laws.<br>

          Paxton‚Äôs lawsuit, filed in district court in Harrison County, alleges that Facebook collected users‚Äô
          biometric identifiers from photos and videos without properly informing them, shared the data with third
          parties and failed to delete it in a timely way, from about 2010 to late 2021 ‚Äî when Meta announced it would
          shut down Facebook‚Äôs facial recognition system and delete the data it collected on more than 1 billion people.

        <blockquote>
          An experimental algorithm out of Facebook‚Äôs artificial intelligence lab can recognise people in photographs
          even when it can‚Äôt see their faces. Instead it looks for other unique characteristics like your hairdo,
          clothing, body shape and pose.

        Not looking? We can figure out who you are.

          Rebecca Porter, we discovered, is my great aunt, by marriage. She is married to my biological grandfather‚Äôs

        Hey, if it can figure out your family tree, when everyone between you and this other person doesn't use
        Facebook at all, it sure as hell can figure out who you are from your voice.

          Forbes: Sep 26, 2018: Exclusive: WhatsApp Cofounder Brian Acton Gives The Inside Story On #DeleteFacebook And Why He Left $850 Million Behind
        </a>
        <blockquote>
          If walking away from $850 million feels like penance, Acton has gone further. He has supercharged a small
          messaging app, Signal, run by a security researcher named Moxie Marlinspike with a mission to put users
          before profit, giving it $50 million and turning it into a foundation. Now he‚Äôs working with the same people
          who built the opensource encryption protocol that is part of Signal and protects WhatsApp‚Äôs 1.5 billion users
          and that also sits as an option on Facebook Messenger, Microsoft‚Äôs Skype and Google‚Äôs Allo messenger.
          Essentially, he‚Äôs re-creating WhatsApp in the pure, idealized form it started: free messages and calls,
          with end-to-end encryption and no obligations to ad platforms.
        </blockquote>
        Walking away from nearly $1 billion over Facebook's severe lack of privacy should say something.
