Usage of Premium is defined as claiming it in a server, as we do not track usage beyond that.
If, according to our records, you have used Premium, we only offer prorated refunds for the
remaining time left on your subscription.<br>This is in compliance with the
<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019L0770&from=ES">European Union Directive 2019/770</a>,
section 32 of the preamble, and Articles 5(2)(b), and 12(3) of the directive.</section><section class=section><h2>Downtime Refunds</h2><p>If the Service is offline, or in some other way, unusable, for a time period longer than 24 hours,
we will offer a account credit proportional to the amount of time the Service was unusable.
This credit can be used to purchase Premium, or other services we may offer in the future.<br>This is in compliance with Directive 2019/770, Article 18(2).</section><section class=section><h2>Requesting Refunds</h2><p>To request a refund, please send a direct message to the bot.
A human will respond to you as soon as possible.</section><section class=section><h2>Quality Concerns</h2><p>If you're concerned about the quality, or would like to try it out, we do offer free trials
of Premium, and weekly subscriptions, for this reason.
To request a trial, please send a direct message to the bot.
A human will respond to you as soon as possible.
Weekly subscriptions can be purchased via the same method as any other subscription.</section><section class=section><h2>Disputes and Chargebacks</h2><p>Disputes or chargebacks will result in a permanent ban from Scripty, except in very exceptional
circumstances.
We want to work with you to resolve any issues you may have, so please contact us first if you
have any issues.</section><section class=section><h2>Legal Rights</h2><p>Nothing in this policy can override your legal rights, as defined by the laws of your country.
